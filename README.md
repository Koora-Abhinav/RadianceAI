# RadianceAI

The project involves developing a Solar Irradiance Prediction System to forecast solar energy output. These predictions are then utilized as input for a LLAMA 2-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The RAG system retrieves and explains complex topics specifically related to solar energy, utilizing the predicted data. This integrated approach aims to provide insightful explanations and insights into solar energy-related topics by combining advanced prediction capabilities with state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques offered by LLAMA 2.
